# Node-Express boilerplate

## General information

A simple boilerplate for a Node-Express website.
It uses:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [IcedCoffeeScript](http://maxtaco.github.io/coffee-script/)
* [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)
* [Winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston)
* [Handlebars](https://github.com/pillarjs/hbs)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

Both client scripts and server code can be made in IcedCoffeeScript.
The app will automatically compile scripts and stylesheets for the client into Javascript and put them into the correct folder.
